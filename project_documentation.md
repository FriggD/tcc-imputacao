# Neural Network Sequence Model Implementation Documentation

## Project Overview
This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with attention mechanism using PyTorch. The model consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) cells and attention mechanism for improved sequence processing. The system is designed to learn patterns in sequences and generate corresponding output sequences.

## Implementation Details

### Class Interactions and Data Flow
1. The process begins with data preparation in `ModelData` class:
   - Reads input data from files
   - Creates vocabulary through `Lang` class
   - Handles data masking and sample preparation
   - Splits data into training and testing sets

2. Training flow (`train.py`):
   ```python
   Input Data -> Encoder -> Hidden States -> Attention Decoder -> Output Sequence
   ```
   - `trainIters()`: Main training loop
     * Initializes optimizers for both encoder and decoder
     * Creates training pairs from input data
     * Runs training iterations with loss computation
     * Periodically evaluates model performance
   
   - `train()`: Single training iteration
     * Processes one input-target pair
     * Computes loss and updates model parameters
     * Implements teacher forcing for better training

### Core Components

### 1. Data Handling (impute.py)
The data handling is managed through two main classes:
- `Lang`: Handles vocabulary and word-to-index mapping
- `ModelData`: Manages data processing, masking, and sample preparation

### 2. Model Architecture

#### Encoder (encoder.py)
The encoder is implemented as `EncoderRNN` using GRU cells for sequence processing. It:
- Takes input sequences and converts them to hidden representations
- Uses GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) for better handling of long-term dependencies
- Processes input sequences one element at a time

#### Decoder with Attention (attnDecoder.py)
The `AttnDecoderRNN` implements:
- Attention mechanism for focusing on relevant parts of input sequence
- GRU-based decoding of the encoded sequences
- Output generation with attention weights

### 3. Training Process (train.py)
The training process includes:
- Iterative training with batches
- Optimization using encoder and decoder optimizers
- Loss calculation and backpropagation
- Progressive learning with teacher forcing

### 4. Evaluation (evaluation.py)
Evaluation methods include:
- Random sample evaluation
- Comprehensive evaluation of all samples
- Computation of evaluation metrics

## Technical Details

### Detailed Architecture Analysis

#### EncoderRNN Class
```python
class EncoderRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        # Initializes embedding layer and GRU
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.gru = nn.GRU(hidden_size, hidden_size)
```
- **Purpose**: Converts input sequences into hidden representations
- **Components**:
  * Embedding layer: Converts input tokens to dense vectors
  * GRU layer: Processes embedded sequences
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Embeds input tokens
  2. Passes embeddings through GRU
  3. Returns output and hidden state

#### AttnDecoderRNN Class
```python
class AttnDecoderRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, output_size, args):
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(output_size, hidden_size)
        self.attn = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, max_length)
        self.gru = nn.GRU(hidden_size, hidden_size)
```
- **Purpose**: Generates output sequences using attention
- **Components**:
  * Embedding layer: For target sequence tokens
  * Attention mechanism: Focuses on relevant encoder outputs
  * GRU layer: Processes combined context
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Embeds current input token
  2. Calculates attention weights
  3. Creates context vector
  4. Generates output prediction

### GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
The project uses GRU cells which are a type of RNN that:
- Handles vanishing gradient problem better than simple RNNs
- Has simpler architecture compared to LSTM
- Uses reset and update gates for controlling information flow

#### GRU Architecture
```
Input -> Reset Gate -> Update Gate -> Current Memory -> Output
```
- **Reset Gate**: Controls how much past information to forget
- **Update Gate**: Determines what information to update
- **Current Memory**: Combines new input with past information
- **Advantages**: 
  * Faster training than LSTM
  * Effective for shorter sequences
  * Better gradient flow

### Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism implemented in this project is a key component that allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during generation.

#### Implementation Details
```python
# In AttnDecoderRNN class
def forward(self, input, hidden, encoder_outputs):
    # 1. Embed input
    embedded = self.embedding(input).view(1, 1, -1)
    embedded = self.dropout(embedded)

    # 2. Calculate attention weights
    attn_weights = F.softmax(
        self.attn(torch.cat((embedded[0], hidden[0]), 1)), dim=1)
    
    # 3. Apply attention to encoder outputs
    attn_applied = torch.bmm(attn_weights.unsqueeze(0),
                            encoder_outputs.unsqueeze(0))
```

#### Key Components
1. **Attention Calculation**:
   - Combines current decoder state with input embedding
   - Uses softmax to create attention distribution
   - Weights are learned through training

2. **Context Vector Creation**:
   - Weighted sum of encoder outputs
   - Captures relevant input information
   - Combined with current decoder state

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Processes combined context and hidden state
   - Generates probability distribution over vocabulary
   - Uses log softmax for numerical stability

### Training Process Details

#### Main Training Loop (trainIters)
```python
def trainIters(lang, modelData, encoder, decoder, args):
    encoder_optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(encoder.parameters(), lr=args.lrate)
    decoder_optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(decoder.parameters(), lr=args.lrate)
    criterion = torch.nn.NLLLoss()
```
- Initializes optimizers for both models
- Uses SGD optimization with specified learning rate
- NLLLoss for sequence prediction
- Periodic evaluation of model performance

#### Single Training Step
```python
def train(input_tensor, target_tensor, encoder, decoder, ...):
    encoder_hidden = encoder.initHidden()
    encoder_optimizer.zero_grad()
    decoder_optimizer.zero_grad()
```
1. Forward Pass:
   - Process input through encoder
   - Generate decoder outputs with attention
   - Calculate loss against target sequence

2. Backward Pass:
   - Compute gradients
   - Update model parameters
   - Optional teacher forcing
